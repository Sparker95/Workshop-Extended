# Workshop Extended

## This mod has been merged to Reforger and is now the Mod Manager since version 0.9.6. This mod alone makes no sense any more.

This mod for Arma Reforger extends in-game Workshop UI and adds new features:
- List view with mods. You can easily enable/disable or delete mods.
- Mod presets.
- Mod bar which shows enabled mods.
- Useful utilities: generate JSON for dedicated server, generate -addons CLI parameter based on enabled mods.

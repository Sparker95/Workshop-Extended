WARNING

To use the mod you must start the game with parameter:
-addons WorkshopExtended
In Steam: Right-mouse click -> Properties -> General -> Launch Options -> type the parameter there.
That's only way to modify main menu, meaning it's not possible to use this on consoles!


About Mod

The mod extends in-game Workshop UI and adds new features:
- List view with mods. You can easily enable/disable or delete mods.
- Mod presets.
- Mod bar which shows enabled mods.
- Button to update all mods.
- Main page of Workshop now shows 5x4 grid with mods, instead of 4x3 grid.
- Useful utilities: generate JSON for dedicated server, generate -addons CLI parameter based on enabled mods.
